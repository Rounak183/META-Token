# Meta Token Contract

This repository contains a Solidity program that implements a custom token - META's contract. The contract provides functionalities for minting tokens, burning tokens, managing token balances for addresses, and checking token balances for specific addresses.

## Requirements

To compile and deploy the contract, you need the following:

- Solidity compiler
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- Test network or local blockchain for deployment and testing

## Contract Overview

The custom token contract consists of the following functions:

- `mint`: This function allows the creation of new tokens and adds them to the balance of the specified address. 

- `burn`: This function enables the removal of tokens from an address, effectively reducing the token balance. 

## Getting Started

To get started with the custom token contract, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies and tools mentioned in the Requirements section.

2. Compile the Solidity contract using your preferred Solidity compiler. Ensure that the compiler version matches the one specified in the contract.

3. Deploy the contract to your desired Ethereum development environment or test network. Make sure to configure the necessary parameters, such as the token name, symbol, and initial supply.

4. Interact with the contract by calling its functions using appropriate addresses and input parameters. Test different scenarios to ensure the contract behaves as expected.

### Executing Program 

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
